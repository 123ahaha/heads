# For this to work:
#  - io386 module needs to be enabled in board config (sandy/ivy/haswell know to work)
#  - coreboot config need to enable CONFIG_BOOTMEDIA_LOCK_CONTROLLER=y without enabling CONFIG_INTEL_CHIPSET_LOCKDOWN
#  - Heads is actually doing the CONFIG_INTEL_CHIPSET_LOCKDOWN equivalent here.
# TODO: If more platforms are able to enable CONFIG_INTEL_CHIPSET_LOCKDOWN in the future, have board config export APM_CNT and FIN_CODE and modify this script accordingly

#include ash shell functions (TRACE requires it)
